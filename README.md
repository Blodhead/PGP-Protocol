# PGP-Protocol

The OpenPGP Project is an open-source implementation of the OpenPGP standard for encrypting and signing digital data. 
OpenPGP provides end-to-end encryption for secure communication over the internet. 
It uses a combination of symmetric-key encryption and public-key cryptography to ensure the confidentiality and authenticity of the data being transmitted. 
The project is written in Java programming language.

With OpenPGP, users can encrypt and sign their email, files, and other digital data, making it accessible only to authorized parties. 
The project is designed to be easy to use, yet secure and flexible, making it a valuable tool for anyone who wants to protect their digital privacy and security.
